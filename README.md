# IMBH readme

This repository contains code and data used in the analysis of optical transient alerts around host galaxies from ~2Mpc-120Mpc, searching for evidence of TDEs caused by IMBH in globular clusters and compact stellar systems in general.

| Hyperleda_load.ipynb          | Jupyter NB | code    | Initial code and query to extract data from Hyperleda database,  along with augmentation of data estimation for GC counts.                |
| HLgalaxies_SDSS_extract.ipynb | Jupyter NB | code    | Suplemental to NB above, this code estimates the effective radius  of the host galaxies to ensure the alert cone search is appropriate. |
